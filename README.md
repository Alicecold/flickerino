In order to run the project, you need to provide your own Flickr API key


Make file named _secret.xml_, like below (but with your own API key), and put it in the res/values folder.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
    <string name="flickr_key">[api_key]</string>
</resources>
```


Kind of questionable choice of format but at least it's something ðŸ™ƒ
